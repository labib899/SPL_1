# Project Description: 
A network utility tool using C++ that can perform various tasks related to analyzing, monitoring, and diagnosing issues with network traffic and performance.

The tool could be used to gather data about network activity, such as the amount of data being transferred, the speed at which it is being transferred, and the types of devices and protocols being used.

It could also be used to monitor the performance of the network, detecting any bottlenecks or other issues that may be impacting its speed and reliability.

Additionally, the tool could be used to diagnose connectivity issues, helping to identify the cause of any problems and suggesting possible solutions.

Overall, such a tool would be a valuable resource for IT professionals and network administrators, as it would provide them with the information and insights they need to optimize the performance and reliability of their networks.
